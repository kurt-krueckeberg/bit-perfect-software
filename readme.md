# Bitperfect Software Options

## Linux

- [Rune Audio](https://www.runeaudio.com/) - free. The RuneOS is based on Arch Linux.
   It is not designed to be installed on a PC rather used on Raspberry PI-like hardware.

- [Kodi](https://kodi.tv) is an entire media management and server package. 

- [LibreELEC](https://libreelec.tv/) Just enough OS for KODI. The SD creator currently only runs on Windows. 
   It is not clear if you can install it on a PC?

- [Daphile](https://daphile.com/) is a headless music server + OS. Thus a client/server model.
  - [Install instructions](https://daphile.com/download/DaphileInstallation.pdf) 
  - [youtube install guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iydBilo5UXI)

- [Universal Media Server](https://www.universalmediaserver.com/download/)

- [Open Source Media Center](https://osmc.tv) Free. Has AppImage.
  Only works on three devices--Apple RV, Vero 4K and Rsspberry PI.

- [Emby](https://emby.media/linux-server.html) Free. Is a media server. It is a .deb package.

- [Audirvana](https://audirvana.com/) is Windows-only.

Others. See <https://circuitdigest.com/article/top-media-server-software-for-music-streaming-on-raspberry-pi>

## Windows

- Audirvana+ Windows

- Foobar on Windows + chord audio drivers.

- MUSIChi software suite

- XXHE. No real written docs just a forum.


## Plan

Only Emby and JRiver seem like easy to install and get up and running options.
