Linux

- [Rune Audio](https://www.runeaudio.com/) - free software. RunOS is based on Arch Linux.

- [Kodi](https://kodi.tv) 

- [OpenELEC] - OpenELEC is a Linux-based embedded operating system built specifically to run Kodi, the open source entertainment media hub.
   The idea behind OpenELEC is to allow people to use their Home Theatre PC (HTPC) like any other device one might have attached to a TV,
   like a DVD player or Sky box. Instead of having to manage a full operating system, configure it and install the packages required to turn it into a hybrid media center, OpenELEC is designed to be simple to install, manage and use, making it more like running a set-top box than a full-blown computer.
